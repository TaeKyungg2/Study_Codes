Great question! Here's a clear explanation of the terms **build**, **compile**, and **run**—especially in the context of C and C++:

---

## 1. Compile
- **What it means:**
  - The process of converting your human-readable source code (`.c` or `.cpp` files) into machine code (object files, like `.o` or `.obj`).
- **Tool:**
  - The compiler (`gcc` for C, `g++` for C++).
- **Example:**
  - `g++ main.cpp -c` produces `main.o`.

---

## 2. Build
- **What it means:**
  - A broader term that usually includes **compiling** and **linking**.
    - **Linking** combines object files and libraries into a final executable program.
- **Tool:**
  - The compiler (with linker), or a build system (like `make` or `cmake`).
- **Example:**
  - `g++ main.cpp -o main` compiles and links in one step, producing the executable `main`.

---

## 3. Run
- **What it means:**
  - Actually executing the compiled program (the `.exe` or binary file) on your computer.
- **Tool:**
  - The operating system runs the executable.
- **Example:**
  - On Mac/Linux: `./main`
  - On Windows: `main.exe`

## Why are there three stages?
- **Compile:**
  - Turns your code into machine instructions, but not yet a complete program.
- **Link (part of build):**
  - Combines all pieces (your code + libraries) into a single executable.
- **Run:**
  - Starts the program so you can interact with it.

**In practice:**
- For simple programs, "build" and "compile" are often used interchangeably, because the compiler does both steps at once.
- For larger projects, you might compile many files separately, then link them together.

## Summary Table

| Stage    | What happens?                        | Output         |
|----------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| Compile  | Source code → Object code            | `.o` or `.obj`|
| Link     | Object code + libraries → Executable | `.exe`/binary |
| Build    | Compile + Link (whole process)       | Executable    |
| Run      | Execute the program                  | Program runs  |
